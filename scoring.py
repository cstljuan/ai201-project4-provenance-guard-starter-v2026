"""
Turning two numbers into one, and one number into something a person can read.
← YOU BUILD THIS IN MILESTONES 4 AND 5

Two functions live here, and both are stubs.

`combine_signals` is where your false-positive decision from Milestone 1
actually gets made. Everything above it — the labels, the appeal path — is
downstream of a number this function produced.

`score_to_label` is where you stop writing for a machine and start writing for
a person. A score of 0.62 means nothing to a writer.

⚠️ Your README's **Signals and Scoring** section has to name the file and
function holding your combining rule. The grader checks your code against what
you claim, so that line should read `scoring.py::combine_signals`.

import config


def combine_signals(model_score: float, style_score: float,
                    phrase_score: float | None = None) -> float:
    """
    Combine the signals into one 0-1 score. Higher means more likely AI.

    The rule, in words:

      1. Weighted average: model 0.40, style 0.30, phrases 0.30 (config.py).
         With no phrase score, the model and style weights are rescaled to
         sum to 1.
      2. Disagreement pulls toward the middle. When the model and style
         signals are more than DISAGREEMENT_GAP apart, the combined score is
         pulled halfway back toward 0.5. Two methods disagreeing IS
         uncertainty, and "unsure" is the label that costs a real writer
         least.
      3. Nothing is called AI on one signal alone. If the score lands in the
         AI band but the style signal reads human-ish (below 0.5), the score
         is capped just under the AI threshold, so it shows as "unsure".

    Rules 2 and 3 only ever move a score away from "ai", never toward it.
    That's the false-positive decision from Milestone 1: a missed detection
    is cheaper than a wrong accusation.

def score_to_label(score: float) -> tuple[str, str]:
    """
    Turn a score into a guess and the text a reader actually sees.
    ← TODO (Milestone 5)

    Returns:
        (guess, label_text) — where `guess` is a short machine-readable string
        like "ai" / "human" / "unsure", and `label_text` is the full sentence
        shown to a person.

    ⚠️ Write the label text for someone who has never heard the word
    "threshold".

        ✗ "human, 0.81 confidence"
        ✓ "We think this was probably written by a person."

    All three labels have to be **reachable**. If no score can produce one of
    them, your ranges have a gap — and Milestone 5 asks you to submit text that
    produces each one, which is how you'd find out.

    The hardest one to write is "unsure". It has to admit uncertainty without
    sounding like an accusation, because the person reading it may well have
    written every word themselves. Your breakout asks your group what they'd
    think if they got it on their own work. That question is the whole
    milestone.
